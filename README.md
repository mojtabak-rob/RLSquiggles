# Squiiiiigggllleeeee
Depp RL for Dr. Squiggles

Just for now, as we develop:

### Running current training loop 
run cart_pole.py with 
```
python3 cart_pole.py
```

### Visualize
For joint_sound.wav: Dark voice is environment, light voice is agent.

To see a plot of environment state, run visualize.py with
```
python3 visualize.py
```

To get the .wav sound files, you must have the module wavio. If you don't have it, and can't get it, comment out "import wavio" at top and "make_soundfile()" in main (four lines).
