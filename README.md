Depp RL for Dr. Squiggles

Just for now, as we develop:

### Running current training loop 
run cart_pole.py with 
```
python3 cart_pole.py
```

### Visualize
To see a plot of environment state, run visualize.py with
```
python3 visualize.py
```

To get the .wav sound file, you must have the module wavio. If you don't have it, and can't get it, comment out the import wavio and make_soundfile() lines (two lines).
